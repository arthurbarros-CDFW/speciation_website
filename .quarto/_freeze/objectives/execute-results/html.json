This is\npart of an ongoing effort by the California (Coastal) Monitoring Plan\n(CMP) Sonar Subgroup to provide support to survey efforts using sonar to\nestimate abundances of migrating adult salmonids. Often distinguishing\nspecies for a given fish using a sonar image can be difficult due to\nimages that are low-resolution and at an angle that makes identification\ndifficult. The difficulty of accurate speciation can be compounded in\nsystems when many different species are present at the same time,\nespecially if those fish are of similar size classes and produce similar\nacoustic profiles.\n\nI do not aim to provide a \"blanket\" method for species apportionment\nthat can be applied to all sonar imaging studies. Each watershed is\ndifferent, and has different auxiliary data available for use. Also, the\nmethods detailed do not aim to replace visual identifications made by\nscientists with local knowledge and identification experience. Instead,\nthis document will provide examples of statistical methods that can\nutilize auxiliary data to aid in assigning species identifications to\nsonar movement data where visual identification is not possible. Some of\nthese methods have been briefly described in @Atkinson2016, and I hope\nthe following methodology provides additional helpful detail on how to\nimplement the techniques.\n\nWe will begin with the most simple methods, incorporating the barest of\nauxiliary data sets, and build upon those with increasingly more complex\nmethods and data sets. Hopefully by the end, the reader can better\nevaluate how to tackle their sonar imaging data and what auxiliary data\nthey can use to increase the accuracy of species apportionment.\n\nThis will be a \"living\" document, with continues updates and edits being\nmade while we continue to explore and test various speciation methods.\nThroughout this document, various chunks of R code will be presented in\nthe following format:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\"hello reader\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"hello reader\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese chunks are designed for users to copy and paste, or rewrite\nentirely, into their own R scripts to replicate the methods.\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n",

abstract = {Dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) offers important advantages over other sampling tools for observing pelagic and benthic fishes in situ. Because it relies on sound, DIDSON can detect fish in a non-destructive and non-intrusive manner. In our unique application, the equipment's small size and low power requirements allow deployment from a kayak for increased maneuverability in complex habitats. Characteristics that typify echograms of different fishes can be extracted using multivariate ordination techniques, such as principal components analysis (PCA), with in situ groundtruthing. Here we present reference images, techniques, and human-observer-error estimates from DIDSON application. Together, these approaches enhance our ability to sample fishes and even observe certain behaviors in complex, turbid environments during a full diel cycle. {\textcopyright} AlphaMed Press 2014.},

abstract = {We present a semiautomated analytical ap- proach incorporating both image and acoustic processing techniques to apply to dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) data. Our objectives were (1) to develop a standardized analysis pathway in order to reduce the effort associated with counting, measuring, and tracking fish targets; and (2) to empirically obtain estimates of basic target information (e.g., size, abundance, speed, and direction of travel). Analyses were conducted on DIDSON data collected at three different locations (the Kenai River, Alaska; Mobile River, Alabama; and Port Fourchon, Louisiana) with different equipment and deployment configurations. We developed an efficient postprocessing approach that can be applied to a variety of data sets, independent of user and deployment method. For two of the three data sets analyzed, the estimates of fish abundance derived from DIDSON analyses were not significantly different from the manual counts of DIDSON files. The analyses produced estimates of mean fish length, direction and speed of travel, and target surface area for all targets within each data set. A consistent analysis platform increases the acceptance and reliability of the DIDSON as a tool for fisheries surveys and further demonstrates the usefulness of DIDSON technology in fisheries applications.},

abstract = {We used an ARIS 1800 and a DIDSON (LR) multi-beam SONAR unit to monitor Chinook salmon escapement in the Elwha river on a daily basis from June 4 th , 2014 through September 10 th , 2014. We reviewed 20-minutes of each hour long file and then adjusted these raw counts for expansion to full hour counts, species composition, observer error, and filling data gaps. This process yielded a non-jack Chinook escapement estimate above the SONAR sites of 4,360 fish, with a coefficient of variation of 3.5% (95% CI 4,050-4,685). We also provide channel specific estimates of passage for the Hunt Road Channel (HRC), 3,040 (3.1% CV, 95% CI 2,860-3,230) and the Old Mainstem (OM) 1,320 (8.7% CV, 95% CI 1,100-1,545). In addition, we estimated coefficients of variation for each of the sources of uncertainty: observer error (3.6%), 20 minute expansion (3.4%), species composition (2.8%), and data gap fill (>.1%). Fifty percent of the Chinook run had passed the SONAR sites by July 20 th this year, which was 5 days earlier than 2013 and 11 days earlier than 2009-2012. We also caught the first Chinook during species composition netting three weeks earlier this year than in 2013, June 4 th vs. June 25 th. Our escapement estimate of 4,360 non-jack Chinook salmon compares favorably with other data from the watershed. A redd survey covering most of the spawnable watershed on September 17 th , 2014, in combination with collections for the WDFW hatchery yielded an approximate total of 5,200 Chinook salmon. This year's estimate is an improvement on prior years because we placed an additional SONAR in the previously under monitored Old Mainstem channel and we implemented species composition netting. Therefore, we had a more complete data set and were able to estimate CV's for each source of uncertainty in our estimate. Reviewing the large amounts of data produced by the continuous operation of two SONARs in addition to organizing the logistics and field crew needed to maintain the in stream species composition netting will be the biggest challenges facing the project as it moves forward.},

abstract = {The reliability of sockeye-salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) count data collected by a dual-frequency, identification sonar (DIDSON) system is evaluated on the basis of comparisons with visual counts of unconstrained migrating salmon and visual counts of salmon constrained to passing through an enumeration fence. Regressions fitted to the DIDSON count data and the visual count data from the enumeration fence were statistically indistinguishable from a line with slope = 1.0 passing through the origin, which we interpret as agreement in both counts. In contrast, the regressions fitted to the DIDSON count data and the unconstrained visual count data had slopes that were significantly <1.0 (p < 0.001) and are consistent with an interpretation of systematic bias in these data. When counts of both unconstrained and constrained fish from the DIDSON system were ≥50 fish event-1, repeated counts of the DIDSON files were observed to produce the same counts 98-99% of the time, respectively, and based on the coefficient of variation, counts of individual passage events varied <3% on average. Therefore, the DIDSON count data exhibit high precision among different observers. As an enumeration fence provides a complete census of all fish passing through it, we conclude that fish-count data produced by the DIDSON imaging system are as accurate as visual counts of fish passing through an enumeration fence when counts range up to 932 fish event-1, the maximum count recorded during our study, regardless of the observer conducting the count. These conclusions should be applicable to typical riverine applications of the DIDSON system in which the bottom and surface boundaries are suitable for acoustic imaging, the migrating fish are adult salmon, and the transducer is carefully aimed so that the beams ensonify the area through which the salmon are migrating. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {European Union legislation, through the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), as well as national legislation, such as the 'Grenelle Environnement' (2007) in France, requires restoration of ecological connectivity in streams to improve free circulation of migratory fish. Different methods (e.g. capture by trap or net, telemetry, hydroacoustics) are used to evaluate the efficiency of fish passes to estimate the migratory species abundance and analyse changes in their within-river distributions. Among these methods, hydroacoustics is non-intrusive, allowing long-term observation and description of fish populations based on physical properties of sound in water. However, the main limit to hydroacoustic tools is their difficulty in identifying species. Initially designed for military purposes, dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) has been used in environmental management for a decade. This acoustic camera uses higher frequencies and more sub-beams than common hydroacoustic tools, which improves image resolution and then enables observation of fish morphology and swimming behaviour. The ability to subtract static echoes from echograms and directly measure fish length improve the species-identification process. However, some limits have been identified, such as automatic dataset recording and the low range of the detection beam, which decreases accuracy, but efficient tools are now being developed to improve the accuracy of data recording (morphology, species identification, direction and speed). The new technological properties of acoustic cameras, such as the video-like visualization of the data, have greatly improved monitoring of diadromous fish populations (abundance, distribution and behaviour), helping river and fisheries managers and researchers in making decisions.},

abstract = {Fish escapement is generally monitored using nonreplicated systematic sampling designs (e.g., via visual counts from towers or hydroacoustic counts). These sampling designs support a variety of methods for estimating the variance of the total escapement. Unfortunately, all the methods give biased results, with the magnitude of the bias being determined by the underlying process patterns. Fish escapement commonly exhibits positive autocorrelation and nonlinear patterns, such as diurnal and seasonal patterns. For these patterns, poor choice of variance estimator can needlessly increase the uncertainty managers have to deal with in sustaining fish populations.We illustrate the effect of sampling design and variance estimator choice on variance estimates of total escapement for anadromous salmonids from systematic samples of fish passage. Using simulated tower counts of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka escapement on the Kvichak River, Alaska, five variance estimators for nonreplicated systematic samples were compared to determine the least biased. Using the least biased variance estimator, four confidence interval estimators were compared for expected coverage and mean interval width. Finally, five systematic sampling designs were compared to determine the design giving the smallest average variance estimate for total annual escapement. For nonreplicated systematic samples of fish escapement, all variance estimators were positively biased. Compared to the other estimators, the least biased estimator reduced bias by, on average, from 12% to 98%. All confidence intervals gave  effectively identical results. Replicated systematic sampling designs consistently provided the smallest average estimated variance among those compared.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic landscape alteration has negatively affected riverine habitat and hydrologic processes, which in turn has reduced the viability of salmonid species that depend on healthy watersheds for spawning, migration, rearing, growth, and survival. As society increasingly demands more water and other natural resources, the ability of managers to conserve these resources will be based, in part, on their ability to maintain and restore watershed processes. California's salmon and steelhead trout populations have experienced drastic declines leading to both federal and State Endangered Species Act listings of many coastal stocks (Good et al. 2005, Williams et al. 2011, CDFG 2002, CDFG 2004). California has experienced pressure from the federal government, other Pacific States, fisheries organizations, and communities to improve status and trend monitoring of coastal salmon and steelhead trout. Of the four National Marine Fisheries Service's Viable Salmonid Population (VSP; McElhany et al. 2000) parameters (abundance, spatial distribution, productivity, and diversity), adult abundance is the most fundamental. Establishment of DIDSON counting stations under California's Coastal Salmonid Monitoring Plan (CMP) (Adams et al. 2011) in key locations will enable the Department to obtain vital adult return data to inform State, Trans-State, and federal management and recovery actions. Since 2006, dual frequency identification sonar cameras (DIDSONs) have been installed in California streams to enumerate adult salmon and steelhead trout during upstream migration. We report on the operational and biological results of initial deployments of DIDSON units across California for the primary purpose of counting returning anadromous salmonids. Principally, this work has been undertaken as part of CMP, but DIDSONs have also been deployed in several Central Valley watersheds. Additionally, we report on the laboratory experimental results conducted on a DIDSON unit at the University of California, Davis, and the sturgeon work performed in the Central Valley. This is the first comprehensive report of the use of DIDSON devices in California's watersheds.},

A 5% subsample of DIDSON data contained 43 793 fish targets, the majority of which were of Excellent (15.7%) or Good (73.01%) observation quality. Excellent quality DIDSON targets (n = 6876) were apportioned by species using a Bayesian mixture model based on four known fork length distributions (river herring (alewife, Alosa psuedoharengus, and blueback herring, Alosa aestivalis), American shad, Alosa sapidissima) and two size classes (one sea-winter and multi-sea-winter) of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). 76.2% of targets were assigned to the American shad distribution; Atlantic salmon accounted for 15.64%, and river herring 8.16% of observed targets. Shad-sized (99.0%) and salmon-sized (99.3%) targets approached the fishway almost exclusively during the day, whereas river herring-sized targets were observed both during the day (51.1%) and at night (48.9%). This approach demonstrates how multibeam sonar imaging can be used to evaluate community composition and species-specific movement patterns in systems where there is little overlap in the length distributions of target species.},

abstract = {We tested the feasibility of using a dual frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) to count migrating adult salmon in turbid Alaskan rivers as a potential replacement for Bendix echo counting sonars. Our evaluation was divided into five main components: 1) a comparison of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) counts from DIDSON, Bendix sonar, and split beam sonar against visual tower and video counts; 2) a range test in a turbid river to test the DIDSON's detection limits; 3) a comparison of two sonars (DIDSON and split beam) at the Miles Lake sonar site; 4) a comparison of two sonars (DIDSON and Bendix) at the Kenai River; and 5) a test of the performance of the DIDSON on rocky river bottoms and artificial substrates. The sonar, video, and tower methods produced similar sockeye salmon counts in the clear Wood River, although the split beam sonar was only tested at relatively low fish passage rates. We detected an artificial target 17-18 m from the transducer in the turbid Copper River. More total fish were counted from DIDSON images compared to counts obtained from split beam sonar echograms with the largest difference occurring in the first 5 m at the Miles Lake sonar site on the Copper River. The discrepancy was greater if downstream-moving fish were subtracted from upstream-moving fish. In the turbid Kenai River, a DIDSON (high frequency) and Bendix sonar comparison of fish counts produced mixed results with one dataset producing regression slopes close to one while a second dataset was more dissimilar. From DIDSON images, we observed a variety of fish behaviors that could impact counts made by more traditional sonars. We successfully deployed DIDSON and observed fish over rocky river bottoms and artificial substrates. Advantages of the DIDSON include easy-to-detect images of fish; a wider viewing angle, better coverage of the water column, simpler aiming and operation, accurate upstream-downstream target resolution, background subtraction feature, less multipathing, and reasonable measures of fish length out to 12 m. Disadvantages include limited range capabilities, high electronic data loads, and manual target counting. In addition, the majority of the DIDSON's electronics are deployed in the river making the unit vulnerable to damage from debris. Better data storage methods and automated fish counting software are being investigated. The DIDSON exceeded our expectations for counting salmon in turbid rivers and is our choice for a Bendix sonar replacement.},

abstract = {For this side-looking, 200 kHz, split-beam sonar application, echo-envelope length has been shown to be predictive of fish size. In this study, this relationship is exploited to estimate the abundance of (large) chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the presence of (smaller) sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). The echo-length to fish-size relationship is too imprecise to ascertain the species of individual fish in the classic sense. However, the frequency distribution of echo-length measurements contains information on the relative abundance of chinook and sockeye salmon. The use of echo-length measurements in a mixture model is explored in order to estimate the proportion of total fish passage that comprised chinook salmon. Inputs to the model include empirical estimates of the length-frequency distribution for each species, parameter estimates from the regression relationship of echo-length to fish-length, and echo-length measurements from individual, ensonified fish. Outputs are estimates of the proportions of chinook and sockeye salmon in the river. The advantages of the mixture-model approach over threshold-based discrimination are discussed. Conditional maximum likelihood and Bayesian versions of the model are described. The method can be generalized to other hydroacoustic measurements, including target strength and other discrimination problems. {\textcopyright} 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

This study provides the first estimate of Sacramento River Green Sturgeon run size and initiates a time series of abundance that can inform Endangered Species Act recovery processes. Furthermore, these absolute abundance estimates provide a context for evaluating the significance of impacts, such as bycatch in coastal fisheries or entrainment in water diversions, where the number of impacted individuals is known.},

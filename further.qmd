# What apportionment method is right for you?

This methods documentation does not aim to dictate to sonar surveys the
"correct" method to assign species to sonar fish counts. Choosing the
right species apportionment method depends on the available auxiliary
data, the degree of overlap in species covariate distributions (length,
date, etc.), and the desired level of certainty. Simple methods like
in-season cutoffs may be appropriate for systems with well-separated run
timings, while in-season species proportioning provides a better
alternative when some overlap exists. Logistic regression models allow
for the incorporation of additional covariates, such as fish length and
environmental variables, improving accuracy. For studies involving
multiple species with overlapping distributions, multinomial logistic
regression or Gaussian mixed models can offer robust solutions for
species ID.

-   There is no one-model-fits-all solution for speciating sonar counts.

-   The more complex your fish community, the more complex the methods,
    and the more detailed the data needed.

-   The methods available to you depends on the detail and proximity of
    the auxiliary data available for inference.

# Potential future methods

The speciation methods that have been reviewed are far from an
exhaustive list of techniques that can utilize auxiliary data to inform
sonar count species assignments. As the CMP Sonar Subgroup continues to
explore methods of utilizing sonar imaging to enumerate migrating
salmon, we hope to expand upon this list. Some potential avenues for
further exploration include:

-   Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to capture non-linear
    relationships between covariates and species identity.

-   Incorporating acoustic telemetry as an auxiliary data set to expand
    escapement estimates [@Maxwell2019].

-   Utilizing a Bayesian framework to incorporate informative prior
    knowledge and Bayesian updating as more data becomes available
    [@Grote2014, @Fleischman2003].

-   Exploring machine learning methods used to process sonar imagery
    files to also incorporate statistical methods for automatic species
    assignment.
